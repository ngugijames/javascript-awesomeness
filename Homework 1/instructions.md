# Introduction to Computer Graphics Assignment One

YOU MUST PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING IN SOME TYPE OF CONTAINER (tar,,zip, etc)
- A README DESCRIBING WHAT YOU DID AND DID NOT DO, YOUR ENVIRONMENT, 
PLATFORM, BROWSER, ETC.
- THE SOURCE CODE FOR YOU SUBMISSION – INCUDE EVERYTHING WE NEED TO RUN 
YOUR SUBMISSION

Our first assignment has one real purpose and that is to make sure you can get your 
environment up and running and see something on your screen. This may include a 
browser supporting WebGL – Stick with, in no particular order, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

The following is required for the assignment:
1. Get a simple WebGL element (canvas) to display without error.
2. Implement the various shader codes needed to get primitives onto the screen as 
illustrated in the lecture and in Chapter 2 of the text.
3. Implement the Sierpinski Gasket algorithm from Chapter 2 of the text and display it 
on the canvas. Use the coordinates (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5) and (0.0, 0.5) as the initial 
seed points of the algorithm.
4. Implement the assignment in a clean and understandable manner. You can use 
whatever coding style you prefer but your code must be readily understandable for 
grading (e.g. comments).
Extra Credit – some of these require some basic understanding on web programming. Any 
of it should be simple enough to figure out from online resources or your friends.
1. Implement a application based color variable that can be passed through to the 
fragment shader – 10 points.
2. Implement a method where the keyboard is used to change that color variable and 
redisplay – 5 points.
3. Implement another function in your window similar to the Sierpinski Gasket, 
another fractal perhaps? Provide a keyboard input option to switch between the two 
on screen, please explain in your notes what function you implemented - 10 points.
4. Implement a rotation in the vertex shader and rotate the fractal via keyboard by 
pressing the ‘r’ key. Rotation direction is up to you. – 10 points
